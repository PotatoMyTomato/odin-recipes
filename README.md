I will demonstrate my knowledge thus far in creating basic HTML websites by exemplifying the following:
    -Creating a basic boilerplate HTML website
    -Including a header with a title, a body of content, and ordered list items
    -Contains several href links that link all pages to each other and back to the main page
    -Is also my first real coding project so enjoy!!
